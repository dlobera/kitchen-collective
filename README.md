# Kitchen Collective
### Kitchen collective is a web app to create recies and share them with friends and family. Specifically I wanted to create a page where my grandma could easily login and share recipes with me so I'll stop losing the papers she gives me. I wanted it to have a granparent kitchen feel when you land on my page, mixed with a little modern fun to represent our relationship and the bond we experince through coming together and creating the most delicious recipes in the kitchen.
